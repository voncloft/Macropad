Rev-B RGB Phase 1 (Safe Template)
Date: 2026-03-01

Goal
- Implement per-key RGB on SW1-SW4 first to validate:
  - Footprint orientation
  - DIN/DOUT chain direction
  - 5V/GND routing strategy
  - Clearance with hotswap sockets and case

Placement source
- File: RGB_PHASE1_PLACEMENT.csv
- Keys included: SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4

Recommended temporary designators
- RGB1 near SW1
- RGB2 near SW2
- RGB3 near SW3
- RGB4 near SW4

Net template
- RGB data in from existing chain input: LED_DIN
- RGB1 DIN  <- LED_DIN
- RGB1 DOUT -> RGB2_DIN
- RGB2 DOUT -> RGB3_DIN
- RGB3 DOUT -> RGB4_DIN
- RGB4 DOUT -> RGB_DOUT_PHASE1 (test/export)
- All RGBx VDD -> 5V
- All RGBx GND -> GND

Required pass criteria before scaling to all 26
1. KiCad DRC: 0 violations, 0 unconnected.
2. Visual orientation check:
   - DIN/DOUT pins face expected routing direction across SW1-SW4 chain.
3. Mechanical sanity:
   - No overlap with switch/hotswap pads.
   - No encroachment into mounting holes/keepouts.
4. Power sanity:
   - Existing C401 bulk cap remains valid for startup tests.

Scale-up rule
- Once phase-1 passes, replicate same LED orientation and chain direction across SW5-SW26.
