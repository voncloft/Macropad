Rev-B Next Actions (Immediate)
Date: 2026-03-01

Already completed
- RGB_DATA naming standardized in PCB/schematic.
- HALL_OUT net created in PCB; U901 pad 35 assigned.
- Display opening and pocket enlarged in case generator and STLs regenerated.

Next implementation pass
1) Schematic device additions
- Add hall sensor symbol (3V3/GND/HALL_OUT) and optional RC filter footprint.
- Add per-key RGB LED symbols (WS2812/SK6812 class) and chain labels.
- Confirm RGB_DATA -> first LED DIN path and LED_DIN intermediary node strategy.

2) PCB additions/routing
- Place hall sensor footprint at intended edge/control location.
- Add at least one Hall testpoint on HALL_OUT.
- Place per-key RGB footprints and route daisy chain DIN/DOUT.
- Add bulk capacitor near RGB 5V entry and local decoupling near chain start.

3) Validation
- Run KiCad DRC after each major placement/routing chunk.
- Regenerate production exports only after DRC returns 0/0.

Notes
- Do not change encoder or LCD I2C pin assignments unless conflicts appear.
- Keep reset-hole alignment tied to SW402 current location.
